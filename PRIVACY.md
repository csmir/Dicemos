## üìÖ Data collection

### Rolled dices

Dices rolled for each user are kept in history, to chart usage, input and count outcomes. 
This can be accessed via the profile. It is not possible for a user other than the executing user, to access this data.

### Interaction usage

Data is kept about your command & component usage. 
As a command is executed, a **command total** is incremented. 
As a button is pressed, a **component total** is incremented. 
After every command executed, it's name will be stored as your **latest command**. 
The latest command is replaced by its previous entry. Command details are not stored.

### Users

Each user has a unique ID provided by Discord. 
Dicemos uses this ID to associate you with entities it keeps in reference to you.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data storage

Data is stored in a MongoDB server, locally hosted on the same machine as Dicemos itself. 
It is safely protected by a security manager & password system. 
The port MongoDB communicates over is locked externally, so no traffic from outside the machine can interfere with or keep tabs on your data. 
> If this security somehow fails, and your data is somehow grabbed or deleted, 
Dicemos will notify you along other users of this event in its built-in notification system.

## ‚ùå Disagreement
